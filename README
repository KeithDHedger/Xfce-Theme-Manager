DEPENDENCIES:

Bash 4.x
gtkdialog version 0.8.x
glib-2.0
gdk-2.0
cairo
zenity 2.32

USAGE:
xfce-theme-manager [-m] [-u]

-m force a make of all the thumbnails for meta-themes/frames/controls/cursors and icons.
-u just build misssing thumbnails

The thumbnails are stored in ${HOME}/.config/XfceThemeManager
The first time you use Xfce-Theme-Manager you should either run it from the command line with the -m switch or click on the "Rebuld DB" button, the first build of the DB can take a while so be patient!
The DB only needs updating if you add/change/remove a theme/icon set.

Meta Themes are themes that contain a gtk2 folder and an xfwm4 folder (ie window frames and controls), if their is a gnome-like theme.index file that also specifies an icon set this will be used as well.

If you change an individual setting ( window border, icon etc ) the 'Custom' theme will be updated and can be clicked on to set a theme like any other meta theme.
You will lose your custom meta-theme if you rebuild the DB either from the command line or from the GUI.

INSTALL:
Extract the archive say into /tmp, cd into /tmp/Xfce-Theme-Manager/gtkpreview, run sudo make install, this will iinstall both the gtkprev app and the Xfce-Theme-Manager GUI.
The GUI can be run from the command line or from the settings menu.

There is no configure script as the makefile is very simple, default is to install in /usr/local/bin this can be changed by setting the PREFIX variable prior to make install.

If you have a source based pkg manager like slackware the dev files for glib etc should already be installed, if you are using a debian based install you may have to install the dev packages as well, probably somthing along the lines of glib2-dev/gdk2-dev check your installation documentation for further details.

You may have to run  xfce4-panel --restart to see the Xfce-Theme-Manager menu item in settings.
