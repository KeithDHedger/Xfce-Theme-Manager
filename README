DEPENDENCIES:

Bash 4.x
gtkdialog version 0.8.x
glib-2.0
gdk-2.0

INSTALL:
Extract the archive say into /tmp, cd into /tmp/Xfce-Theme-Manager/gtkpreview, run make;sudo make install, this will iinstall both the gtkprev app and the Xfce-Theme-Manager GUI.

There is no configure script as the makefile is very simple, default is to install in /usr/local/bin this can be changed by setting the PREFIX variable prior to make install.

If you have a source based pkg manager like slackware the dev files for glib etc should already be installed, if you are using a debian based install you may have to install the dev packages as well, probably somthing along the lines of glib2-dev/gdk2-dev check your installation documentation for further details.

Enjoy!
