EXTERNAL APPS:

Xfce4-Composite-Editor Available here:
http://gtk-apps.org/content/show.php/Xfce4-Composite-Editor?content=149523&PHPSESSID=f9317d406c1ed0e51799fb6b6a1e3e32
****************************************************

USAGE:
xfce-theme-manager [-m] [-u]

-m force a make of all the thumbnails for meta-themes/frames/controls/cursors and icons.
-u just build misssing thumbnails

To install a theme/gtk/icon/cursor/border/wallpaper just drag and drop the archive ( wallpapers should not be archived ) anywhere on the main window and if posible the theme etc will be installed into the correct place, all installations are local, supported archive types are:"*.tgz","*.gz","*.zip","*.tar","*.bz2", supported wallpaper types are:"*.jpg","*.png","*.bmp","*.gif" anything else you will have to install yourself.

The thumbnails are stored in ${HOME}/.config/XfceThemeManager
The first time you use Xfce-Theme-Manager you should either run it from the command line with the -m switch or click on the "Rebuld DB" button, the first build of the DB can take a while so be patient!

The DB is updated automatically on drag'n'drop, if you do a lot of adding and removeing of themes/icons etc you may want to run Re-build DB from the advanced tab.

Meta Themes are themes that contain a gtk2 folder and an xfwm4 folder (ie window frames and controls), if their is a gnome-like theme.index file that also specifies an icon set this will be used as well.

Spanish is now catered for if you have set the 'LANG' enviroment variable properly, other translations are invited email me for a list to be translated.

INSTALL:
Extract the archive say into /tmp, cd into /tmp/Xfce-Theme-Manager, run sudo make install, this will iinstall the Xfce-Theme-Manager GUI and the desktop file.
The GUI can be run from the command line or from the settings menu.

There is no configure script as the makefile is very simple, default is to install in /usr/local/bin this can be changed by setting the PREFIX variable prior to make install.

If you have a source based pkg manager like slackware the dev files for glib etc should already be installed, if you are using a debian based install you may have to install the dev packages as well, probably somthing along the lines of glib2-dev/gdk2-dev check your installation documentation for further details.

You may have to run  xfce4-panel --restart to see the Xfce-Theme-Manager menu item in settings.

If you are upgrading from an older version please rebuild the DB ( fro the "Advanced" tab ).
