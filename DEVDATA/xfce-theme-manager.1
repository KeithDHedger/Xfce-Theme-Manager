To install a theme/gtk/icon/cursor/border/wallpaper just drag and drop 
the archive (wallpapers should not be archived) anywhere on the main window
and if posible the theme etc will be installed into the correct place, 
all installations are local, supported archive types are: "*.tgz","*.gz","*.zip","*.tar","*.bz2", supported wallpaper types are: "*.jpg","*.png","*.bmp","*.gif"
anything else you will have to install yourself.


You must have unzip installed to drag 'n' drop .zip files.


The thumbnails are stored in ${HOME}/.config/XfceThemeManager.


The DB is updated automatically on drag'n'drop, if you do a lot of adding and
removing of themes/icons etc you may want to run Re-build DB from 
the advanced tab.


Meta Themes are themes that contain a gtk2 folder and an xfwm4 folder (ie window frames and controls), if there is a gnome-like "theme.index" file that also specifies an icon set this will be used as well.
